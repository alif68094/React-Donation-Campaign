# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Three Most Important Feature!!
- You can donate as much as you want. All donation will save in donation page!!
- If you click on any donation sub category it will take you to a dynamic path  where you can see the details of that sub category.
- There is a statistics page where you can see a pieChart of your donation percentage against total donation.
